The chief of security department Mr. Lee has received some input from intelligence 
and based on that he has issued a notice to top ministers of the country that the number plates 
outside their office rooms need to be updated with random numbers till further notice to cause
confuse in attackers mind.

All other ministers have agreed to it except the Prime minister.

He says since he is the Prime Minister he will only have a 4 digit prime number on his office room. 
He will let Mr. Lee know the current number of his office room and 
the number he finally wants to have.

The working constraint are such that workers who work on the plate can only work in the night time
since during the day office work goes on.
Also in one night's time only one digit on the plate can be changed. 
 
And on top of that the Prime minister has 2 conditions.

1. Every morning he comes to work, he only wants to see a 4 digit prime number on the number plate.
2. He wants the change work to finish in the least number of days possible. 

Suppose Prime minister currently has the number 1033 and wants to change it to 8179. (Note: Both are prime numbers)
Then overnight the 1 can't be changed to 8 as 8033 is not a prime number and the Prime minister won't be pleased with this number.
So the changes will take place in the following order 
Night 0:	1033
Night 1:	1733
Night 2:	3733
Night 3:	3739
Night 4:	3789
Night 5:	8779
Night 6:	8179

So it will take total six nights to complete.  

Given 2 prime numbers please help Mr. Lee to find the minimum number of nights in which work can be finished which in short can be 
called shortest prime path between 2 prime numbers. ï»¿ 

Input

One linewith a positive number: the number of test cases . Then for each test case, oneline with two numbers separated by a blank. Both numbers are four-digit primes(without leading zeros).

Output

For each test case, output Two line for eachcase first output line of each test case should be Case #tn, where tn is the test case number.

Second Line either with a number stating the minimalcost or containing the word Impossible.
