There is a businessman going through multiple cities doing trade. He starts from his hometown with only money and does the buying / selling of fruits or pays entry tax throughout his journey. He has to pass through multiple cities (max 20) during his journey in the given order. At each city he has 3 options -

 (1) He pays the entry tax and continue his journey with the existing fruits
 
 (2) He purchases local fruits of quantity Q at double price of entry tax
 
 (3) He trades Q of his exising fruits in lieu of entry tax


He keeps his fruits sealed in a (very big) single sealed bag. As he opens his bag to take out the fruits to trade for entry tax, all the fruits are affected by the different weather of the city and start to rot. A fruit can withstand at max 3 adverse weathers exposures. Any fruit left out after 3 exposures will be a waste and cannot be accepted as a settlement for entry tax at 4th city.
It should be noted that such exposure will not happen when fresh fruits are bought and dropped to the sealed bag.
