Refuelling Robot
 
 
 There are N cars parked in a row in a parking lot of the newly 
 constructed club of Mr Vivek, Mr Shashank and Mr Sangeet.

 On both side of the parking garage as it is demonstrated in the picture below 
 there is a gasoline and diesel fueling station installed.
 
 An automatic fueling robot which is 
 made by Mr Kshitij, carries the fuel from station and fill up the parked car with fuel.

                          <===  R ===> 
                                ^
    GASOLINE ---- D ---- D ---- G ---- G ---- G ---- D ---- G ---- D  ---- DIESEL
  

 The cars are divided into 2 types depending on whether it is a gasoline or diesel car.
 
 The automatic robot will be used to provide a cost free fuelling service which is filling up 
 all cars with 1 litre of each corresponding fuel.
 
 The robot will move in between the 2 fuelling stations as below : 
 
 
 1) The robot carries 2 litre of gasoline at the gasoline station and starts moving from there.
 2) The robot can fill up the cars of the same type of gas it carries 1 litre each.
 3) The robot can go back to the fuelling station at any time, Independent from the current amount of fuel it carries.
 4) When the robot arrives at the fuelling station, it gets 2 litre of supply of the corresponding fuel.(If the robot has some remaining fuel it will be discarded).
 5) There is an equal distance of 1 between each fuelling station and the cars.
 
 The fuel type of N Cars parked in the parking lot will be given.
 
 As Mr Sangeet is on phone call and there is lot of disturbance due to the movement of this new robot, so
 so he wants the job to be completed as soon as possible.
 
 Hence find the minimum moving distance of the automated fuelling robot after it has filled up all the cars with 1 litre  of fuel each.
 
 
 Example 1)  Given the total number of cars N = 5 and the order of the parked cars such as G - D - G - D - G

the process of finding the minimum moving distance for fuelling the car is as follows :
