> Discussed as early as ~2003.
> Patent filed
> Frameworks:
  1. Angular, 
  2. Ember, 
  3. ExtJS, 
  4. React, and 
  5. Meteor

Benefits of SPA:
---------------
A. Thin Server - 
   - Business Logic transferred to Client.
   - Less Server queries
B. Increased Responsiveness – 
   - Complex / Responsive UIs are easier to develop.
C. separates UI and data
D. Closer to User
E. easy to debug
F. works and feels more like an application then a web page.
G. Scalable
H. moves much of the MVC implementation to the client


GitHub as SPA
--------------
> Low-end interactivity
> Pages are mostly static.
> Represents mostly static piece of information already processed, and add a bit of interactivity via Javascript.
> Changing data usually causes a full page refresh.
> State and data can be stored in HTML, because if data is altered, the page is refreshed.
> Because a majority of the state is in the HTML, parts of the UI do not generally interact with each other. 
> If complex interactions are needed, they are resolved on the server.

Gmail as SPA
--------------
> High-end interactivity
> Pages are mostly dynamic.
> Contains set of data which user interacts with in various ways; changes to the data reflected on the page immediately.
> Changing data update the views, but not cause a page refresh - because views have many small intermediate states which are not stored in the database.
> Storing state and data in HTML is a bad idea, because it makes it hard to keep multiple views that represent the same data in sync.
> Complex interactions are more feasible; data is separate from presentation.
> Interactions don't need to map to backend actions, e.g. you can paginate and select items in a view without writing a new server-side endpoint.

Challenges of SPA
-----------------
> Browser History
> Analytics
> Client must enable javascript
> Only one entry point to the site
> Security (– easy to fake. can easily fake JSON data communication to test SPA, and can also easily fake JSON requests to server to write unit tests.)
> SEO Optimization
